# An-Empirical-Study-on-How-the-Developers-Discussed-about-Pandas-Topics
Pandas is defined as a fast, easy open-source software library
that is used for data analysis in Python programming language. It is
rapidly used in different projects like software development, machine
learning, computer vision, natural language processing, robotics, and
others. Software developers show huge interest and discussions are
becoming dominant in online developer forums, like Stack Overflow (SO)
in pandas. Such discussions can help to understand the importance,
prevalence, and difficulties of pandas topics. The aim of this work is
to find the popularity and difficulty of pandas topics. In this regard,
SO posts related to pandas are collected. Topic modeling is done on the
textual contents of the posts. We found 26 topics which we further categorized
into 5 board categories. We observed that developers discuss
variety of pandas topics in SO related to error and excepting handling,
visualization, External support, dataframe, and optimization. Also, a
trend chart is generated according to the discussion of topics in a predefined
time series. The finding of this paper provides a path to help
developers, educators, and learners. For example, beginner developers
can learn most important topics in pandas. Educators can understand
the topics which seem hard to learners and make different tutorials that
makes these topic understandable. From empirical study, it is possible to
understand the preferences of developers in pandas topic by processing
their SO posts.
